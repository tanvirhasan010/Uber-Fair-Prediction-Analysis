# 🚗 Uber Fare Prediction Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project focused on predicting Uber ride fares. The project explores various factors that influence Uber pricing, builds predictive models, and provides insights into the dynamics of ride-hailing service costs. This end-to-end project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the relationship between Uber fares and various factors such as distance, time, location, and demand.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
- **Model Development**: Build and compare multiple machine learning models for fare prediction.
- **Insight Generation**: Identify key factors that significantly impact Uber fare pricing.
- **Deployment Ready**: Create a model that could be integrated into a fare estimation application.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset likely includes the following features (may vary):
- **Temporal Features**: Date, time, day of week, month
- **Geographical Features**: Pickup and dropoff coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- **Trip Details**: Trip distance, estimated duration
- **Contextual Features**: Number of passengers, possibly surge multiplier
- **Target Variable**: Fare amount

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Geopy, Folium (if applicable)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Model Evaluation**: Various regression metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab

## 📈 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Data type conversion and formatting
- Removing erroneous or inconsistent records

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate analysis of individual features
- Bivariate analysis against the target variable (fare)
- Temporal patterns analysis (time of day, day of week effects)
- Geographical analysis of pickup/dropoff patterns
- Correlation analysis between variables

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Distance Calculation**: Haversine distance between pickup and dropoff points
- **Temporal Features**: Extracting hour, day, month, season from datetime
- **Geographical Features**: potentially clustering locations or calculating city zones
- **Derived Features**: Speed, time-based features, peak hour indicators
- **Categorical Encoding**: Handling location-based categorical variables

### 4. Model Development
- **Data Splitting**: Train-test-validation splits
- **Baseline Model**: Establishing a simple benchmark
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Trying various regression approaches:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - Possibly Neural Networks
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

### 5. Model Evaluation & Selection
- Performance comparison using multiple metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R-squared (R²)
- Residual analysis
- Feature importance analysis

### 6. Insights & Conclusions
- Key factors influencing Uber fares
- Business recommendations based on findings
- Limitations and potential improvements

## 🚀 Key Findings (Expected)

Based on the analysis, the project likely reveals:
- **Primary Fare Drivers**: Distance as the strongest predictor of fare amount
- **Temporal Patterns**: Higher fares during peak hours, weekends, and special events
- **Geographical Patterns**: Variation in fares based on pickup/dropoff locations
- **Surge Pricing Impact**: How demand affects pricing (if surge data is available)
- **Model Performance**: Which algorithm provides the most accurate predictions

## 📊 Results

The best performing model likely achieves:
- **RMSE**: [Value] (represents typical prediction error in dollars)
- **R² Score**: [Value] (percentage of variance explained by the model)
- **MAE**: [Value] (average absolute prediction error)
